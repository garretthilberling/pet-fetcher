## Description
Pet&#128062;Fetcher is dedicated to enriching the lives of all pets looking for their forever homes, as well as that of their humans who are either in need of companionship, or relief of the same.

Whether you are looking for the perfect match for your unwanted pet, or finding that one of a kind friend to join your family - we can help.

Search our database for available pets, or list your pet for adoption so others can make a connection that will make both lives the best they can be!

The languages and technologies used to build this full-stack application are: JavaScript, ES6, MySQL, mysql2, Sequelize, bcrypt, express, express-handlebars, express-session, connect-session-sequelize, body-parser, CSS, Tailwind CSS, UIKit, & the implementation of the MVC file structure.

## Usage
Simply create an account and post your furry friend! Feel free to leave a comment and like other users' posts!

When a pet is selected you are taken to a page that displays the contact information of the user who listed that pet. Users handle sales directly! (Think ex: Craigslist). You can upload a JPG or PNG of your furry friend by navigating to the dashboard (only available to logged-in users).
